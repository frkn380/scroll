### Purpose or design rationale of this PR

This PR updates the version information in the common/version/version.go file.
Specifically, it increments the patch version by 1 to reflect a new release.

Why does it do it?
Keeping track of version changes is essential for maintaining consistency and ensuring that consumers of our software can identify the latest release.
By updating the version, we signal that there have been changes or improvements in the codebase.

How does it do it?
The PR parses the existing version from the version.go file.
It increments the patch version by 1.
